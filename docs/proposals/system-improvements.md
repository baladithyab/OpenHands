# System Improvements Proposal

## 1. Decoupled Architecture

### Server-Frontend Separation
- Implement a microservices architecture to separate the server and frontend
- Use gRPC for efficient inter-service communication
- Enable multiple autonomous agents to run in parallel through:
  - Agent pool management
  - Load balancing
  - Resource allocation
  - State synchronization

### Benefits
- Improved scalability
- Better resource utilization
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Easier maintenance and updates

## 2. Development Environment Enhancement

- Replace current Docker-based development environment with Nix
- Benefits:
  - Reproducible builds
  - Declarative configuration
  - Better dependency management
  - Atomic upgrades and rollbacks
  - Cross-platform compatibility

### CodeAct 2.1 Integration
- Enhance CodeAct agent with dev environment awareness:
  - Direct access to Nix environment variables
  - Understanding of available development tools
  - Access to project-specific configurations
  - Integration with language servers for better code understanding
  - Real-time environment state tracking

## 3. Knowledge Management Enhancement

### Dual-Layer Knowledge Base
#### Session-Localized Knowledge
